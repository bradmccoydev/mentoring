Welcome to the mentoring program this repo is for the mentees to start of with.  For me to mentor you properly please add your name to the [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) with the things you would like to learn.  If you would like to learn something that is not on the list please create an issue in this repo.

## Slack Channel
Please join our Slack Channel [here](https://join.slack.com/t/cloudnative-mentoring/shared_invite/zt-119bf6kae-bSGp7NQYrG~FZmjZjhZ~QA). Once you join please introduce yourself in the #introduce-yourself channel.  I recommend that folks do the free [Inclusive Open Source Community Orientation (LFC102) course](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/inclusive-open-source-community-orientation-lfc102/) before joining it doesnt take long and is really important in the community.
